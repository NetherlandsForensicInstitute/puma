    "# How Appium interacts with the App UI\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started we need to udnerstand how Appium interacts with the UI. On Android the UI consists\n",
    "of elements in a hierarchy, much like an XML document. Appium fetches this hierarchy through the Android\n",
    "Accesability API and exposes this as an XML document to the user. Usually, only visible elements are\n",
    "included, as invisible elements should not be loaded into the Android Accesibility service. However, not\n",
    "all apps are equally well written, and some apps laod in elements too early, while other apps do not\n",
    "load relevant data into the Accesability Service, leaving us navigating XML elements without any contents\n",
    "or attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lucky for us, most of the time there's a few attributes we can use to interact with the desired UI element.\n",
    "Let's take a look at the following UI:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"resources/whatsapp.png\" alt=\"Alt Text\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "If we retrieve the XML element representing the send button (how we do that will be explained later in this\n",
    "exercise), it loks like this:\n",
    "```XML\n",
    "<android.widget.FrameLayout resource-id=\"com.whatsapp:id/send_container\">\n",
    "    <android.widget.ImageButton content-desc=\"Send\" resource-id=\"com.whatsapp:id/send\"/>\n",
    "<android.widget.FrameLayout/>\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you can see, we've the button itself is an `ImageButton` element nested inside a `FrameLayout` element.\n",
    "The good news is that either can be clicked to interact with the button, so we don't need to worry about that.\n",
    "You could idenitify the elements based on the element class, but in this case this will only work when there's\n",
    "just one `ImageButton`. As UIs can become very complex, we usually want something more spcific to go by, which\n",
    "is why we usually also look at attributes.\n",
    "Either of these elements can be identified by their `resource-id`, and the inner element also has a\n",
    "`content-desc` which we can use to identify it. Of these two, the preference usually goes to `resource-id`, as\n",
    "this value is indendant of the configured system language.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we take a look at one of the sent messages, we see the following XML, containing a third attribute that can\n",
    "be useful:\n",
    "```XML\n",
    "<android.widget.FrameLayout resource-id=\"com.whatsapp:id/conversation_text_row\">\n",
    "    <android.widget.TextView text=\"Hello there Alice, long time no see! How have you been??\" resource-id=\"com.whatsapp:id/message_text\"/>\n",
    "        <android.widget.LinearLayout resource-id=\"com.whatsapp:id/date_wrapper\">\n",
    "            <android.widget.TextView text=\"1:21â€¯PM\" resource-id=\"com.whatsapp:id/date\"/>\n",
    "            <android.widget.ImageView content-desc=\"Delivered\" resource-id=\"com.whatsapp:id/status\"/>\n",
    "        </android.widget.LinearLayout>\n",
    "    </android.widget.FrameLayout>\n",
    "</android.widget.LinearLayout>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here we can read the message contents in the `text` attribute, as well as the time the message was sent. Keep \n",
    "in mind that the `text` attribute is even more volatile than the `content-desc`, as it might be determined by\n",
    "both the system language and user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to summarize:\n",
    "* The Android UI is exposed as an XML document through Appium\n",
    "* Selecting elements can be done by looking at the element class and the attribute values\n",
    "* In practice, the attributes `resource-id`, `content-desc` and `text` prove to be the most useful"
