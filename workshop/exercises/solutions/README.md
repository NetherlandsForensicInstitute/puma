In this folder, the Jupyter Notebooks of the exercises with the solutions can be found. Note that part of the solutions
also require changes in the Actions classes. For these, you can refer to the production AppActions classes in 
`puma.apps.android`. For this tutorial, special tutorial AppActions classes are used, these are located in `workshop.apps`
